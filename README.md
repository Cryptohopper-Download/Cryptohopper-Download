## ❓ What is Cryptohopper?

Cryptohopper is a cloud-powered cryptocurrency trading bot designed to execute trades automatically based on pre-defined strategies, technical analysis, and real-time market conditions. It caters to both beginners and professional traders, providing a user-friendly interface combined with advanced trading capabilities.

Unlike many bots that require constant manual intervention, Cryptohopper’s automation ensures that trading strategies run 24/7 without downtime. Users can choose from marketplace strategies created by top traders or customize their own setups using dozens of built-in indicators and triggers. The bot supports spot and futures trading, enabling flexibility across various market conditions.

Its web-based dashboard allows you to monitor your portfolio, performance analytics, and active positions from any device. Additional features include backtesting, paper trading for risk-free strategy testing, and social trading, allowing users to copy the strategies of successful traders.

Cryptohopper integrates with major exchanges, supports arbitrage opportunities, and offers risk management tools such as trailing stop-loss and dynamic position sizing, making it a comprehensive solution for automated crypto trading.
